🧠 Machine Learning: Predicting Profit
We introduced a machine learning workflow to predict profit based on historical sales data. Using scikit-learn and linear regression, we explored how key features like discount, quantity, category, and region influence profit.

Highlights:

Selected relevant features for training

One-hot encoded categorical variables

Trained a linear regression model using train_test_split

Evaluated performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Outcome:
This initial model acts as a baseline for future ML experiments and optimization.
